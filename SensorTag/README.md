# AGILE SensorTag image

This folder contains a modified TI SensorTag image with infinite time advertisement.

While the original firmware advertises and remains connectable only for about 2 minutes after a button press or after a disconnect,
this version goes on advertising infinitely. As such, it is usable for unattended test scenarios.
